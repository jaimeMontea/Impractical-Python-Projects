For a given number of advanced galactic civilizations and an average radio bubble size, estimate the probability of any civilization detecting the radio transmissions of any other
civilization. For perspective, post the size of Earth’s current radio bubble on a 2D graphical representation of the Milky Way.

The script "probability_of_detection.py" estimates the number of transmitting civilizations using the Drake equation and plots the relation between the number of civilizations per 
volume vs the probability that each civilization finds each other. 
The script "galaxy_simulator.py" builds a graphical model of the galaxy and post Earth’s radio emissions bubble.

Modules used: tkinter, random, math, collections, numpy, matplotlib.pyplot
