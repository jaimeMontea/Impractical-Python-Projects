The objective of this project is to generate the three-lines Japanese poems haiku using Markov chain analysis. Allowing the user to
modify the haiku by independently regenerating lines two and three.
The attached file is used in the Markov Chain analysis as a training data to create a new line based on the previous state/line in the poem.
