# Impractical-Python-Projects
These are some exercises from the book Impractical Python Projects by Lee Vaughan. 
These projects consist on many real life problems and other not too orthodox situations which solutions are implemented on Python. 
Examples include: Markov chain analysis to write haiku, Monte Carlo simulation to model financial markets and genetic algorithms to breed an army of giant rats. 
Modules used, among others, are pygame, Pylint, pydocstyle, tkinter, python-docx, matplotlib, and pillow.
