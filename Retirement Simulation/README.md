The objective of this project is to build a Monte Carlo simulation for estimating the probability of running out of money in
retirement. Treat years in retirement as a key uncertainty and use historical stock, bond,
and inflation data to capture the observed cyclicity and dependency of these variables.

The attached files contain the historical data used for running the simulations, including annual evolution of stocks, bonds, inflation and gold rate from 1926 to 2013. 
The user is asked to enter the initial investment type, the starting value of investment and the annual estimated withdrawal so, with a Monte Carlo simulation, the probability of
running out of money for a given years of retirement is returned as output. A graphic of this simulation is shown with matplotlib. 

Modules used: sys, random, matplotlib.pyplot
