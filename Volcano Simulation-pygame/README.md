The objective of this project is to use pygame to build a 2D, gravity-based simulation of Io’s Tvashtar volcanic plume. Calibrate the plume dimensions using a NASA image. 
Use multiple particle types in the plume, trace the particles’ flight paths and allow the eruption to run automatically until stopped.

Modules used: sys, math, random, pygame
